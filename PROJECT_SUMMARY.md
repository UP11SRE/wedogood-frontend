# NGO Reporting System - Project Summary

## Overview

This is a complete, production-ready React frontend application for managing NGO monthly reports. The application is fully functional and can run in mock mode without any backend, making it perfect for demos and development.

## Build Status

✅ All dependencies installed
✅ Development server running successfully
✅ Production build successful
✅ All three pages implemented and functional
✅ Mock mode fully operational

## Quick Demo

The app is currently running in **MOCK MODE** (VITE_USE_MOCKS=true), which means:
- No backend needed
- All features work with simulated data
- Perfect for testing and demonstration

Visit: http://localhost:5173

## What's Included

### Core Pages

1. **Submit Report** (`/submit`)
   - Full form validation with Yup schema
   - Inline and server error handling
   - Toast notifications
   - All fields: ngo_id, month, people_helped, events_conducted, funds_utilized

2. **Bulk Upload** (`/upload`)
   - CSV file dropzone
   - Real-time job polling (2s intervals)
   - Progress bar with processed/total counts
   - Status badges: pending → processing → success/failed
   - CSV format help panel
   - Mock job completes in 5 seconds

3. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`)
   - Month selector (defaults to current month)
   - Four metric cards with Material UI icons:
     - Total NGOs Reporting
     - Total People Helped
     - Total Events Conducted
     - Total Funds Utilized (₹ formatted)
   - Loading states with CircularProgress
   - Empty state for months with no data (try January 2025)

### Technical Implementation

#### State Management
- React Query for server state
- Local component state for UI
- No Redux complexity

#### Form Handling
- React Hook Form with Yup validation
- Type coercion for numbers
- Regex validation for month format
- Field-level error messages

#### API Integration
- Axios client with configurable base URL
- Mock/real API switcher in `src/mocks/index.js`
- Centralized endpoint definitions

#### Polling Logic
- Custom `useJobPoll` hook
- Automatic 2-second intervals
- Stops on success/failed status
- Handles network errors with retry

#### Styling & UX
- Material UI v5 theme system
- Responsive layout (mobile → desktop)
- Consistent spacing and elevation
- Professional color scheme
- Loading skeletons and spinners

#### Accessibility
- aria-label on all inputs
- aria-valuenow on progress bars
- Keyboard navigation
- High contrast
- Screen reader compatible

## Configuration Files

- `.env` - Environment variables (mock mode enabled by default)
- `.env.example` - Template for production
- `.eslintrc.cjs` - ESLint rules (React + Prettier)
- `.prettierrc` - Code formatting rules
- `vite.config.js` - Vite bundler config

## Testing the Application

### 1. Submit Report
1. Go to http://localhost:5173/submit
2. Fill in all fields (try invalid data to see validation)
3. Click Submit
4. Should see success toast and form clears

### 2. Bulk Upload
1. Go to http://localhost:5173/upload
2. Click the dropzone and select any .csv file
3. Click Upload
4. Watch the job status panel:
   - Status changes: pending → processing → success
   - Progress bar fills from 0 to 100
   - Takes about 5 seconds to complete

### 3. Dashboard
1. Go to http://localhost:5173/dashboard
2. See mock metrics displayed
3. Try selecting different months
4. Try January 2025 to see the empty state
5. Click Refresh to re-fetch data

## Mock Data Behaviors

The mock system in `src/mocks/handlers.js`:

- **Submit Report**: Validates required fields, returns success
- **Upload CSV**: Creates a job that progresses over 5 seconds
- **Job Status**: Returns increasing processed count
- **Dashboard**: Returns sample data (except Jan 2025 = empty)

## Switching to Real Backend

1. Update `.env`:
   ```env
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
   VITE_USE_MOCKS=false
   ```

2. Ensure backend implements these endpoints:
   - POST `/report`
   - POST `/reports/upload`
   - GET `/job-status/{job_id}`
   - GET `/dashboard?month=YYYY-MM`

3. Restart dev server

## API Contract Reference

All endpoints documented in README.md with:
- Request/response schemas
- Status codes
- Error formats
- Field validation rules

## Validation Summary

Frontend validates:
- **ngo_id**: Non-empty string, trimmed
- **month**: YYYY-MM format, valid month 01-12
- **people_helped**: Integer ≥ 0
- **events_conducted**: Integer ≥ 0
- **funds_utilized**: Integer ≥ 0

Backend should enforce same rules and return `fieldErrors` for detailed feedback.

## Production Deployment

1. Build the app:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Files output to `dist/`

3. Deploy `dist/` to any static host:
   - Vercel
   - Netlify
   - AWS S3 + CloudFront
   - nginx

4. Set environment variables on the host

## Performance Notes

Build output shows one large chunk (614 KB). For production optimization:
- Consider code splitting with React.lazy()
- Manual chunking for vendor libraries
- Or adjust `chunkSizeWarningLimit` if acceptable

Current bundle includes:
- React + React DOM
- Material UI + Emotion
- React Router
- TanStack Query
- React Hook Form + Yup
- Axios

## Browser Compatibility

Tested and works on:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Known Limitations

1. No authentication/authorization (frontend only)
2. No data persistence in mock mode
3. Single language (English)
4. Currency symbol hardcoded to ₹

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Dark mode toggle
- Export dashboard to PDF/Excel
- Advanced filtering and search
- Pagination for large datasets
- i18n for multiple languages
- User authentication

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist
